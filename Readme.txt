IMPORTANT: In order to compile and run the project, you have to copy the folders from Libraries in your Arduino library folder (usually located in Documents\Arduino, or C:\Users\"Your user name"\Documents\Arduino).

This is a porting of "PIC18F4550 Snake Game on 128x64 GLCD v2" for Arduino Uno. 
The original code is found at http://microelefun.blogspot.ro/2012/11/pic18f4550-snake-game-on-128x64-glcd-v2.html.
This project is based on the library GLCDv3, which is now deprecated and doesn't work with the newest Arduino's board (http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/GLCDks0108).
In this library I've changend the pin number in glcd/config/ks0108_arduino.h.
